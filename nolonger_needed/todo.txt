x equiping equipment    (*** working on this as well as part of attack_roll)
    x model.entity.humanoid.wield(hand, weapon/shield)

    only on those that have the "dead" status message

    get saved as "living" entities, and then upgrade them to player when
    someone logs on as the player
    x I've created model.entity.transfer_living_to_player
        x need to integrate this with control.socks.login
