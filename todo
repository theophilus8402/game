maybe change proficiencies to being feats
    because that's how you would add new proficiencies
    No, I'm not going to do this because simple_weapons are made proficient
        by one feat, the others are one for one

add proficiencies
    for each race
    for each class

make some items that follow pathfinder rules
    finish weapons
    make armor

wield/wear items
    adds bonuses to the appropriate spots
        change it so we add bonuses for weapons via the same path
        Living.add_bonus(bonus, main_hand=True)
    apply str or dex attack bonus
    apply dmg bonuses

check to see if attack connects

determine damage
    Weapon.damage
    Living.damage.main_hand (total)
    Living.damage.main_hand_modifier (could be str)
    Living.damage.off_hand  (total)
    Living.damage.off_hand_modifier (could be dex)
    Living.damage.bonuses

apply damage

kill someone / knock someone out

cast heal
