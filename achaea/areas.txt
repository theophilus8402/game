Green Lake - was east at lvl 65 ~1.2k gp had to push rubble to get to the monster
Sea Lion Cove - at lvl 65, the animals in the cove (except the shark :( )  were easy (not much money)... the spiders in the caves hurt, however!  and they afflict a lot (maybe ok money?)
Creville Assylum - lvl 65, easy, bunch of animals, some money
Doh! Mount R something? - lvl 66, easy except for multiples, good bit of money and experience, a little affliction, can do a quest to blow up a dam an turn in a dagger
darkenwood - arachnoi, good money, good exp!, doable now (groups are still hard)
newhope - lvl 67, good money, painful, good experience
hriddan - lvl 73, a lil hard, hard to get there, but a good paying quest

Shanugis, Elegnem, Nadja, Tordahl... all give stuff great for karma
