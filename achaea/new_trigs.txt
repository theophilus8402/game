You watch in horror, helpless, as Eolan's fist is wreathed in crackling black energy. With a 
diabolical laugh, he stiffens his hand and slowly runs it down your chest, splitting it open as he 
does so. Though you scream in pain and beg to die, Eolan proceeds to rip apart your organs, 
magnifying the pain until you are driven nearly mad. With a detached smile upon his face, he 
proceeds to rip out your sternum and drive it through your already splayed-out body, pinning it to 
the ground and finally killing you.
