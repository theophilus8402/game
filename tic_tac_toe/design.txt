I want to try a few things out:
  * transactions
  * three separate architecture pieces?
    * world <- interactor -> boundaries?? <- UI
  * test driven development
  * I want two different players to be able to play on two different computers
  * I want one player to be able to play via the commandline (i.e. urwid)
  * I want another to be able to play via a website


Transaction(s?):
  * set_piece / undo_set_piece
  * {
        "action": "set_piece",
        "piece": "x",
        "coords": (0, 0),
    }


World:
  * map[3][3]


Universe:
  * all the different worlds
  * players connected


Interactor:
  * keeps track of the players and which symbol is associated with whom


Interface:
  * decide which game to join
  * one player chooses
  * chooses where to place a symbol, but doesn't choose the symbol
    * set_piece (0, 0)
