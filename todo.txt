* character info:
    * race      < living (this will be the "type" dog, human, elf, bear...)
        * store and read
    * level     < living
        * store and read
    * hit dice  < living
        * store and read

        * this can give us flexibility to do visual stuff in the future
* implement move for living entities (i.e. bob.move() instead of move(bob)
* spells
    * need to figure out how to apply known spells to an entity
* maybe move some functions that involve entities into control/entities.py
