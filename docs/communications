check for inputs
    sources of input:
        users remotely logged in
        me at system commandline
        ai either remotely connected in or as part of the same process
    what will this generate?
        a list of msgs:
            msg:
                "hit bob"
                "cast lightning at bob"
                "n"
                "ai plan next move" <- ai type stuff
                "ai set priority gather food"
            entity that created the msg
            time msg was created
            optional time that msg needs to be executed
        NOTE: before adding the msg to the list, I can check the
            entity's known skills list to see if he/she can do the it
        Future: ponder Jon's handle a lil from each person at a time



in main server loop:

    while continue_loop:
        readable, writable, exceptional = select.select(
            world.socket_comms.keys(), world.outputs,
            world.socket_comms.keys(), timeout)

        misc_readable = get_misc_readable()
        readable.extend(misc_readable)

        new_action_msgs = get_new_action_msgs(world, readable)
        world.action_msgs.extend(new_action_msgs)


def get_misc_readable():
    # we might change this in the future
    misc_readable = world.ai_comms.keys()
    misc_readable.extend(world.misc_comms.keys())
    return misc_readable

def get_action_msgs(world, readable_comms):

    action_msgs
    for connection in readable_comms:
        msg_text = connection.recv()
        entity = world.comms(connection)
        new_action_msg = ActionMsg(msg_text, entity, delay=0 seconds)
        action_msgs.append(new_action_msg)
    return action_msgs

    Question: What about getting comms from AI peeps and other odd sources?
        At the get_inputs() stage, they should? look the same, but behind
        scenes, connection.recv() for the AI will have that entity actually
        compute AI type stuff then make some sort of decision.


world.comms = a combination of world.socket_comms, ai_comms, and misc_comms
world.socket_comms = any client socket connections
world.ai_comms = ai stuff that's not socket related
world.misc_comms = for now, might only be the server socket and the system
                        command line interface
