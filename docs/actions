def move(entity, msg):

    if msg == "n":
        do stuff... blah, blah


actions = {
    "n" = move,
    "e" = move,
    "s" = move,
    "w" = move,
    "cast" = cast,
    "ai" = ai_stuff,
    ...
}


What about?

    recurring/periodic stuff:
        meditating
            adds a different msg to the queue:
                "system_change_mp bob 5 reason"
                system/god/world... whatever
                time.now (created)
                time.now + 3 sec (due)
                NOTE: reason is a status msg to look for on the person
                    i.e. meditating...
        dmg over time
            adds a different msg to the queue:
                "system_change_hp bob -3 reason"
                system/god/world... whatever
                time.now (created)
                time.now + 3 sec (due)
                NOTE: reason is a status msg to look for on the person
                    i.e. burning...
        heal over time
        entangle
            "system_check_entangle bob ..."
        cured of a status effect
            "system_clear_status status"


living_known_skills = ["n", "e", "s", "w", "eat", "drink", ...]

humanoid_known_skills = ["wield", "unwield", "wear", "remove", ...]
humanoid_known_skills.extend(living_known_skills)

mage_known_skills = ["cast", "meditate", ...]
mage_known_skills.extend(humanoid_known_skills)

known skills can either be in the base mage_known_skills or in the entity's
    special known_skills slot (i.e. they were blessed with that skill
    or a quest/room gave the entity that skill temporarily)
